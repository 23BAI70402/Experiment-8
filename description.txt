Library Management React App – Description

This is a simple Library Management application built using React.

It allows the user to add, search, and remove books from a list.

At the start, the app already has some sample books stored (The Great Gatsby and To Kill a Mockingbird).

The user can:

Search for books by typing either the title or the author.

Add a new book by entering the book’s title and author in the input fields, then clicking the Add button.

Remove a book by clicking the Remove button next to it.

The interface is designed with simple input boxes and buttons, making it user-friendly.

The app dynamically updates the book list in real time using React’s useState hook for state management.

This experiment demonstrates:

Handling of state in React.

Filtering data based on user input.

Adding and removing items in an array stored in state.

Using map() to display multiple items.

Overall, this experiment shows how to build an interactive and responsive UI for managing data in React.
